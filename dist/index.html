    <h1>GitHub Wiki SEE</h1>
    <p> ðŸ”Ž <i>400,000+ GitHub Wikis, now indexable by your favorite search engine.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>GitHub Wiki Search Engine Enablement</em> (GHWSEE) allows non-indexed GitHub Wikis to be indexed by search
        engines. The <a href="/robots.txt"><code>robots.txt</code></a> and <a
            href="https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/4992#discussioncomment-1448177">HTTP headers</a> on
        this site do not prevent indexing of wiki content and GitHub Wiki content proxied from GitHub and served from
        this service can be crawled and indexed by major search engines.
    </p>
    <p>The situation so far:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href=https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/4992>GitHub prevents indexing of repository wiki
                content</a> through <a
                href="https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/4992#discussioncomment-1448177">HTTP headers</a>.
            The blocking greatly reduces the effectiveness of content of pages on affected Wikis if they cannot be
            searched on search engines such as Google or DuckDuckGo.
        </li>
        <li> GitHub has officially documented that they only index certain GitHub Wikis. According to <a
                href="https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis">GitHub's documentation</a>,
                "Search engines will only index wikis with 500 or more stars that you configure to prevent public editing."
                This provides clarity on the exact criteria being used, which was previously unclear.</li>
        <li> About <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y5V1xVtL-Z4w4yt9mVQuwGCP3s8TgNAS756IKStRUqs/edit?usp=sharing">
                3,300</a> GitHub.com Wikis met an older criteria requiring ~1000+ and can be found on search engines
            such as Google / DuckDuckGo according to a survey in February 2022. </li>
        <li> About <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17yHqnm_cGDrOTCH2TPnpCU9qaxESuF0q0zuoORl76g4/edit">
                4,700</a> repositories have 798 stars and above and can't be directly indexed by search engines from the
            same survey with the older criteria in February 2022. These repositories do not appear to have the "Editing
            Restricted to Repository Collaborators" option turned on. You would likely recognize some of these
            repositories no matter where your expertise may lie. Many of these projects have large amounts of content in
            their Wikis and are very active. </li>
        <li> There are still about 400,000+ GitHub.com Wikis that are below 500 stars and/or publically editable. These
            can't be directly indexed by search engines as well. </li>
        <li>GHWSEE is helping GitHub Wikis that aren't indexable be indexable in search engines and is continually
            decommissioning itself for GitHub Wikis that are directly indexable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> GHWSEE proxies the rendered contents of the pages and has a link with a large button at the top to visit the
        page on GitHub for everyday usage and a link at the bottom explaining what GHWSEE is. The content of this
        service is not meant to be read directly by users and is intended for crawlers. GHWSEE is designed to behave
        like those StackOverflow content mirroring sites that rank high with "stolen" content from StackOverflow but
        with far less ad-farming. Unlike its inspiration, GHWSEE has no ads and tries to make it obvious, quick, and
        easy for users to get to the content they want directly on GitHub.com short of an automatic redirect that may
        make search engines not crawl or index the content.</p>
    <p> Another purpose of GHWSEE is to bring awareness to the issue of GitHub Wikis purposefully not being indexed
        since <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1683#issuecomment-763628184">2012</a>. Many are caught
        off-guard and have produced massive libraries of information that they are unaware of being generally invisible
        to the internet. Likewise, many searching for information in these libraries are not aware that the information
        is invisible to them if it was in a GitHub Wiki. <a href="https://github.com/github/docs/pull/5054">Up until
            April 2021 (9 years since 2012), GitHub did not document this limitation; the only way you knew was by
            previously looking at robots.txt.</a> A warning is still not present in GitHub's UI itself about this
        limitation. By showing up in real-world search results, it is hoped that greater awareness to this issue can be
        made amongst affected communities and projects.</p>
    <p> If you are a GitHub Wiki maintainer, you may want to consider GitHub Pages backed by a public repository for
        your community's content as a more crawlable, stable, blessed, and probably higher search ranking alternative.
        <a
            href="https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis#:~:text=Note%3A%20Search%20engines%20will%20not%20index%20the%20contents%20of%20wikis.%20To%20have%20your%20content%20indexed%20by%20search%20engines%2C%20you%20can%20use%20GitHub%20Pages%20in%20a%20public%20repository.">This
            alternative is also mentioned in GitHub Docs about GitHub Wikis</a>. <a
            href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/website/pull/109">Consider adding an "<em>Edit on GitHub</em>" link to the
            content on GitHub Pages to have an experience closer to wikis, easily permit editing, and to encourage
            contributions</a>. This is the official solution which can be burdensome and you are welcome to continue <a
            href="#usage">using</a> GHWSEE.</a>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> A great example of an organization taking the moving to GitHub Pages route would be the <a
                href="https://libgdx.com/">libGDX</a> cross-platform Java game development framework project. The
            project has migrated their Wiki to their website. The pages are very faithful to the original GitHub <a
                href="https://libgdx.com/wiki/">Wiki page design</a> including the aforementioned "Edit on GitHub" link.
            You can see the Jekyll/GitHub Pages implementation backing this in their <a
                href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx.github.io"> repository</a>. There is also a <a
                href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx.github.io/pull/65">pull request</a> on that repository that can
            be used as a reference as well.</li>
        <li>It is also possible to target a "Editing Restricted to Repository Collaborators" GitHub Wiki itself as well
            from the GitHub repository and deploy to it with GitHub Actions and have it be indexed if the repo has a
            high star count (500+). These Wikis are likely to be whitelisted by GitHub for direct indexing (please test
            first). An example of this can be seen on the <a href="https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2094">Go
                for VSCode repository.</a> </li>
        <li> Some organizations or projects such as <a
                href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/issues/2487">ShellCheck</a> mirror their content themselves
            and choose to keep their Wikis editable. NOTE: GHWSEE cannot automatically disengage itself for wikis backed
            by this setup as it is technically impossible to automatically detect. Please <a
                href="https://github.com/nelsonjchen/github-wiki-see-rs/issues">create an issue</a> if your project or
            any other project still permits editing but mirrors their content themselves and a blacklist entry can be <a
                href="https://github.com/nelsonjchen/github-wiki-see-rs/blob/master/src/decommission.rs#L3283">added</a>.
        </li>
        <li>If you or your organization does any of this, please reach out to me to try to expedite search engines to
            remove GHWSEE's entries from search engine results for the migrated wiki. Please also make sure to produce
            the necessary sitemaps and monitor your own wiki's content indexing progress and ranking via tools such as
            Google Search Console or Bing Webmaster Tools (Bing is also a DuckDuckGo source).</li>
    </ul>
    <p> If you are interested in providing feedback to GitHub or seeing what GitHub staff has said about their blocking
        of Wiki content from appearing in search engines, participate in the discussion here: <a
            href="https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/4992">https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/4992</a>.
        Let us hope that GitHub can find a solution to unblock GitHub Wiki content in harmony with their SEO concerns,
        and GHWSEE can be <a href="#decommissioning">decommissioned</a>. Already, Wikis that are known to be directly
        indexable are skipped by GHWSEE as part of the partial decommissioning. </p>
    <p> For anti-abuse reasons, all links rendered in the service that are going out of GitHub are tagged with
        <code>rel="nofollow <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2019/09/evolving-nofollow-new-ways-to-identify">ugc</a>"</code>
        as to not affect search engine rankings or to promote mass vandalism of GitHub Wikis. This is in addition to
        <code>rel="nofollow"</code> in the original content. </p>
    <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Wiki Reader: Use your favorite search engine! <em>Every</em> query you run searches a corpus that has GHWSEE
            in it. That is the intended interface to the content "on" this service and to get a link to the original
            GitHub content. Do not read or use the content on this site as it may have rendered with errors and is only
            meant for robots. Go directly to the original page on GitHub with the link or button.</li>
        <ul>
            <li> Scripters/Extension Authors/Power Users: If you would like to automatically redirect to the GitHub Wiki
                page on GitHub.com when landing on a GHWSEE page, please see this document for an API and/or examples:
                <a
                    href="https://github.com/nelsonjchen/github-wiki-see-rs/blob/master/AUTO_REDIRECT_API.md">https://github.com/nelsonjchen/github-wiki-see-rs/blob/master/AUTO_REDIRECT_API.md</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Wiki Editor whose Wiki does not meet the native indexing criterias: If you are a GitHub Wiki contributor,
            simply edit your content periodically and the <a
                href=https://github.com/nelsonjchen/github-wiki-see-rs-sitemaps>sitemap generator</a> will eventually
            pick it up and notify search engines. Because this just isn't GitHub.com, don't expect a high ranking as
            your content will probably be on page 2, 3, or worse. That is still much better than the previous
            alternative of not being in the search results at all! Note that it may take quite some time and luck for
            content to be picked up or detected by search engine crawlers and there is no guarantee it will be picked up
            or detected.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If you would like to greatly increase the chances and ranking of your GitHub Wiki content being indexed,
                consider adding a link to your content on GHWSEE to a location where search engines can index. For an
                example of this in action, see how the <a
                    href="https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer#main_mister-main-binary-and-wiki-repo">MiSTer
                    historical computing and gaming recreation project linked a "crawlable wiki" that GHWSEE serves in
                    their README on GitHub which can be indexed</a>. While the link is "nofollow" on the README as
                displayed on GitHub, that attribute is <a
                    href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2019/09/evolving-nofollow-new-ways-to-identify"> of
                    a guideline than a hard rule nowadays </a> for search engines anyway. Repositories can confer their
                own ranking power onto their proxied and indexable Wiki content on GHWSEE.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p> So far, about $300 have been spent on experiments, queries, and so on with this service during its initial
        ramp-up. The good news is that the cost to currently host the service is very low. In lieu of any compensation,
        please consider donating money recurringly or one-time to the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a>
        and/or your time to <a href="https://archiveteam.org">Archive Team</a> projects. </p>
    <h2 id="decommissioning">Decommissioning</h2>
    <p>This service will be completely decommissioned to redirect old links once the block is lifted or GitHub produces
        some other solution to index all useful GitHub Wikis in harmony with their SEO concerns.</p>
    <p>People shouldn't have linked to this site but maybe the warnings weren't big and red enough. <a
            href="https://github.com/nelsonjchen/github-wiki-see-rs/issues/6">Flashing yellow was very unpopular.</a>
        Regardless, let us not contribute to link rot. </p>
    <h3>Ongoing Continuous Partial Decommissioning</h3>
    <p> As of January 2022, GitHub does appear to be letting some Wikis be indexed according to some non-public
        criteria. These small sample of Wikis allow native indexing by not having a <code>x-robots-tag: none</code> HTTP
        header. A Cloudflare Worker is implemented in front of the proxied URLs to check GitHub and automatically
        redirect if the backing page is detected to allow indexing if something doesn't get added to that list on time.
        By automatically redirecting, it is hoped that GHWSEE's entries for that GitHub wiki falls off the search engine
        index and that GHWSEE's ranking may be conferred directly on GitHub's ranking. </p>
    <p>Some projects have chosen to mirror their own wiki's content onto their own site as well. These cannot be
        automatically detected, but may be manually added to the decommission list. </p>
    <p> The small sample of links below help test the partial decommissioning functionality. </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/m/TileDB-Inc/TileDB/wiki">TileDB-Inc/TileDB</a> - 1000+ stars, no editing </li>
